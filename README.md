yet another Serial Terminal

Description
===========

A simple prgoram that can be used for serial communication. The main goal of this 
project is to replace other serial terminal programs that I'm not quite happy 
with and to learn GUI programming with QML and Qt. As a consequence, this
is a work-in-progress and pretty rough.

Prerequisites
=============

* Qt 5.3.1
* Appropriate compiler such as GCC 4.8+
